# Kontribz

Kontribz is a fully decentralized, platform dedicated to collaboration and tasks/bounties management.

It enables organizations to create and manage bounties or tasks, while offering contributors the opportunity 
to complete them and earn rewards. The entire process is conducted with complete transparency, 
featuring real-time progress tracking and an integrated rating system for contributors and organizations. 
Each participant also benefits from a detailed and evolving profile that reflects their contributions and reputation over time.
